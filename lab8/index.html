			<h3>Early Years</h3>
			<p>Davis grew up Catholic and often moved throughout the country. In elementary school, his parents bought him an Apple II which allowed him to gain familiarity with computers. As a teen he bought a Commodore 64 and started programming in assembly. He then earned his Masters in Electrical Engineering from ASU in 1994 and has been quoted as saying, "Everybody knows electrical (engineering) is higher in the engineering pecking order than [computer systems] because it requires real math."</p>

			<h3>Post Graduation</h3>
			<p>Following graduation, Davis worked at Tickmaster with their ticket machines. Davis became an athiest, but after a manic episode, he converted to Christianity. He then went on to create Temple OS which had it's own programming language, text editor, compiler, and kernel with over 120,000 lines of code. He thought that he was told by God to design the operating system and he started posting about it online. Since he started working on Temple OS in the early 2000s, he had less hospital visits, but his condition was still deterioating</p>
