# Coding II
Repository holding all of the work done in my coding II class at Legend High School.

> [!NOTE]
> The class is for sophomore level high schoolers and above. It is understood that most, if not all, of the kids have not programmed with any languages except python. Thus the class focuses on learning about lower level programming languages and the harder topics/challenges that come with them.

# Programming Languages Learned
## 1. Java

We are spending the first few weeks with a higher-level programming language before we deal with any lower-level languages like C or a web based language like javascript.

## Organization
> [!Important]
> The repository is organized based on the different lessons in each week's lab
> + Lab1: Java week one
> + Lab2: Java week two, part one
> + Lab3: Java week two, part two

## Week Summaries
1. Lab1
   - This lab focused upon the basics of programming in java with the scanner util. The lessons focused on teaching the basics of object orientated code, strongly typed variables, and command line input/output.
3. Lab2
   - This lab focused on primative types and more indepth exploration of Java Scanner.
3. Lab3
   - This lab focused on the while and for loops of Java.

> [!CAUTION]
> I wrote all of the code myself without the help of AI. If any of it is stolen for any reason please reference this repository because I have put a lot of work into it. If the code is turned in as your own at Legend High School, I'm not responsible for your academic dishonesty and my commit logs may be used against you
